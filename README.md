# Periodic Lock
An Android app that periodically locks the phone screen for a given time interval.

(work in progress)

## Possible Use Cases
- Health: User wants to limit their time spent on their phone.
- Security: If phone was unlocked before it went missing/stolen, limit the amount of time that unauthorized users may have with your data. (Store this app in a secured folder so unauthorized users cannot disable/delete the app)


## Simple to use
1) Input time interval
2) Toggle on


## Details on use
